# 🧠 Question Answering with Transformers and SQuAD

## 📌 Overview  
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a question-answering system using the Hugging Face Transformers library and the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) dataset.  
It leverages the `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad` model to answer questions based on given contexts, including both a sample from SQuAD and a custom question about the dataset itself.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites
- Python 3.11  
- A Hugging Face account with an API token  
- A computing environment with GPU support (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla T4) for optimal performance  
- Internet access to download datasets and models  

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2
pip install transformers==4.31.0 datasets
````

> ⚠️ **Note:** Installing these dependencies may conflict with other packages (e.g., `pytorch-lightning`, `sentence-transformers`, `kaggle-environments`, `gcsfs`, `bigframes`).
> Resolve environment conflicts if needed.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

* **Hugging Face Login**: If using private models or `datasets` that require auth, use your own API token (e.g., `hf_xxx...`).
* **Environment**: Recommended to run this notebook in GPU-enabled environments like **Kaggle** or **Google Colab**.
* **Dataset**: The SQuAD v1.1 dataset is automatically downloaded via the `datasets` library.

---

## 🚀 Usage Steps

1. Authenticate with Hugging Face (if required).
2. Install dependencies (as above).
3. Load the SQuAD dataset using `load_dataset("squad")`.
4. Initialize the QA pipeline using `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad`.
5. Run inference on:

   * A sample SQuAD question.
   * A custom question with user-provided context.

## 📊 Example Outputs

**Sample Question:**
*“To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?”*
**→ Answer:** *Saint Bernadette Soubirous*

**Custom Question:**
*“What does SQuAD stand for?”*
**→ Answer:** *Stanford Question Answering Dataset*

## 📝 Notes

* The notebook uses fixed versions of `torch` and `transformers` for compatibility.
  Upgrading may require resolving additional dependency issues.
* `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad` is a lightweight model optimized for QA tasks,
  but may not handle complex or ambiguous questions perfectly.
* CUDA kernel compilation may generate harmless warnings (e.g., cuFFT, cuDNN, cuBLAS registrations).
